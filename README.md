# journal_web
Java Script website for displaying journal pages

# OverView
This is the first site I developed for displaying my journal pages.

# Implementation
The website works by having javascript populate the page from a javascript object containing the information about each journal page. 

I have the function set to display a set number of "nodes" per page.
